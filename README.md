# Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning and Behavioral Analysis / Educational Technology

# Project Summary:
                  The project “Quantifying Cognitive Engagement through Lateral Head Movement Analysis” aims to develop a non-intrusive, vision-based system to assess a user’s cognitive engagement in real time. The system captures video input from a webcam, detects and tracks the user’s face, and analyzes lateral head movements to determine attention levels. By quantifying the frequency and duration of head movements, the system classifies engagement as low, medium, or high. This approach provides a practical solution for e-learning platforms, virtual classrooms, and human-computer interaction applications, helping educators and researchers monitor attention without using wearable devices.

The project leverages computer vision techniques, facial landmark detection, and real-time video processing to generate accurate and interpretable engagement metrics. The output can be used to produce attention reports, enabling actionable insights into learning behaviors.
